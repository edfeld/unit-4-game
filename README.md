# unit-4-game
Guessing game
I also call this the crystal collector game.  

The user is presented with a random number and tries to match it.

S/he does this by clicking on the 4 crystals. Each crystal represents a number which is added into the user's total.  The user plays until they hit the match or go over.  At that point the game starts over.
